\chapter*{Abstract}

"The Domain Specific Language for Sound Processing" project was successfully developed by a talented team of students from the Technical University of Moldova, including Mihail Echim, Anastasia Cunev, Stefan Nistor, and Iulian Bercu. This collaborative effort resulted in a comprehensive exploration of sound processing through the creation of a domain-specific language (DSL).

The project report consists of four chapters: an introduction, conclusions, and bibliography, providing a well-rounded analysis of the DSL development process. The students dedicated their research and efforts to gain a deep understanding of both the technical and non-technical aspects involved in implementing the DSL for sound processing.

Throughout the report, the students meticulously detailed the step-by-step process of creating the DSL. They elucidated the rules, specifications, and distinctive characteristics that make the language suitable for sound processing tasks. The report served as a comprehensive guide, providing valuable insights into the language-making process.

The primary focus of the report was to document the extensive work and innovative solutions implemented to address the specific requirements of sound processing. The students aspired to develop a fully functional language that would be accessible and user-friendly, particularly for individuals with a passion for music who sought to explore programming in this domain.

By combining their technical expertise with a genuine enthusiasm for music, the students aimed to deliver a DSL that would empower users to seamlessly integrate programming concepts with their musical aspirations. The ultimate goal of the project was to create a powerful tool that enables aspiring programmers to engage with sound processing in a creative and intuitive manner.

The successful completion of this project contributes not only to the students' academic journey but also to the broader field of sound processing. Their efforts have resulted in a valuable resource that can be utilized by individuals interested in programming, music composition, and exploring the endless possibilities at the intersection of these disciplines.

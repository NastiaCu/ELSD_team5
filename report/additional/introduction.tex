\chapter*{Introduction}
Our project involves the development of a specialized language for sound processing, with the aim of providing practitioners and researchers in the field with a more intuitive and concise way of expressing algorithms for sound processing. To ensure that the language meets the unique needs and requirements of the sound processing domain, we will be undertaking a thorough Domain Analysis, which will involve extensive research into the various techniques and approaches used in the field, as well as analyzing the characteristics and constraints of different types of sound data.

In addition to our own research, we will be utilizing existing resources and documentation in the sound processing domain to inform our Domain Analysis. This may include academic papers, industry reports, and online communities and forums dedicated to sound processing.

Our motivation as a team for this project stems from our passion for sound processing, and our desire to make a meaningful contribution to the field by developing a language that can help to streamline and improve sound processing techniques. We believe that our language has the potential to make sound processing more accessible and intuitive for practitioners and researchers, and to contribute to the advancement of the field as a whole.

Through our Domain Analysis, we aim to gain a deep understanding of the unique challenges and opportunities of the sound processing domain, and to identify the key requirements and constraints that our language must meet in order to be successful. By utilizing a range of resources and tools, and drawing on our own expertise and experience in the field, we are confident that we can develop a language that meets the needs of the sound processing community, and has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field.

To ensure that our language is effective and widely adopted by the sound processing community, we will be taking into consideration the target audience and their specific needs. We will be conducting a thorough analysis of our target audience, which will include professionals and researchers in the sound processing domain, as well as students and enthusiasts who are interested in learning more about sound processing.

Through this analysis, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges and pain points that our target audience faces in their work, and to identify the specific features and functionality that they require in a sound processing language. By taking a user-centered approach, we can ensure that our language is designed with the needs of our target audience in mind, and is therefore more likely to be widely adopted and used.

In addition to considering the needs of our target audience, we will also be analyzing the existing competition and alternatives in the sound processing domain. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of existing solutions, we can ensure that our language provides a unique value proposition and addresses the key pain points of practitioners and researchers in the field.

Overall, the development of our specialized sound processing language is aimed at providing practitioners and researchers in the field with a more intuitive and concise way of expressing algorithms for sound processing. By designing a language that is tailored to the unique needs and requirements of the sound processing domain, we aim to streamline and improve sound processing techniques, making them more accessible and intuitive for users of all levels.

To achieve this goal, we are undertaking a rigorous process of Domain Analysis, which involves extensive research and analysis of the various techniques and approaches used in the field, as well as a deep understanding of the characteristics and constraints of different types of sound data. Through our analysis, we aim to identify the key requirements and constraints that our language must meet in order to be successful, and to develop a language that meets the needs of the sound processing community.

By taking a user-centered approach and considering the needs of our target audience, we can ensure that our language is designed with the needs of practitioners and researchers in mind, and is therefore more likely to be widely adopted and used. Additionally, we will be analyzing existing competition and alternatives in the sound processing domain to identify the strengths and weaknesses of existing solutions, and to ensure that our language provides a unique value proposition and addresses the key pain points of users.

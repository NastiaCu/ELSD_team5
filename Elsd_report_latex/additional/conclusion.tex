\chapter*{Conclusions}
\par In conclusion, this project aims to create a DSL for sound processing that provides a more intuitive way to express sound processing algorithms. DSLs are designed with a specific focus in mind and can provide easy-to-use tools. By creating a DSL, programmers have the opportunity to customize the tool to their specific needs, which can significantly speed up the development process for larger projects. Compared to General Purpose Language, a Domain Specific Language can provide a higher level of abstraction, which can make them more approachable to non-programmers or those with less programming experience.

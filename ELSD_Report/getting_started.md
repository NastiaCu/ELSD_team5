# Getting started
This is a starting guide on the LaTeX project containing a project report for groups from Technical University of Moldova. 


## Prerequisites
* Knowledge of the basics of working with LaTeX,
* Understanding of the structure of a LaTeX project,
* A LaTeX editing/runtime environment.


## Compiling and running the project
There are several options on setting up a LaTeX runtime environment.

### Running the project locally:
  * If you want to compile/run your LaTeX project locally you'll need the following things:
    * MiKTeX: A TeX distribution that provides all the programs necessary for LaTeX work,
    * An editor: You can choose a LaTeX editor from the multiple existing ones (e.g. texStudio, Texmaker etc.)
  * **NOTE**: Setting up a local environment usually requires additional configurations so you'll need to google some things probably.

### Running the project online:
  * You can use Overleaf:
    * Overleaf is an online platform that provides also a runtime environment for LaTeX projects.
    * One big advantage that can come in handy is the share/collaboration feature which enables multiple users to edit the same project.
    * In order to start working on the project you need to upload a zip of the project to your project on Overleaf.
    * **NOTE**: If you'll run into errors that you cannot solve reach out to the mentor responsible for the project template.
